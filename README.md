/* Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. A function is created called generatePassword().
2. A variable called password is created and set to an empty string.
3. A variable called length is created and set to an integer value of 16.
4. A variable called chars is created and set to a string of all the characters that the password could contain.
5. A variable called arr is created and set to a new Uint32Array with a length of 16.
6. The window.crypto.getRandomValues() method is called and passed in the arr variable.
7. A for loop is created that loops through the length of the arr variable.
8. The password variable is concatenated with the new random character from the chars variable.
9. The password variable is returned. */




index fix.js
/* Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. We start off by defining the characters that will be used in the password.  This includes numbers, lower and upper case letters, and special characters.  You can change this to suit your needs.
2.  We create an array of random numbers using the browser's crypto API.  This array will be the same length as the password that we want to generate.
3.  We use the random numbers to select characters from the chars string.  We do this by taking the modulus of the random number and the length of the chars string.  This will give us a number between 0 and the length of the chars string.  We can use this number to index into the chars string to get a random character.
4.  We take the random character and add it to the password.  We do this for each random number in the array.
5.  We return the password.  This is the password that we generated.  You can do whatever you want with it, including copy it to the clipboard. */
